# springboot-rsocketsetup-example
![Build](https://github.com/gregwhitaker/springboot-rsocketsetup-example/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

An example of sending a `SETUP` payload with [RSocket](http://rsocket.io) and Spring Boot.

RSocket allows for data to be sent on connection setup. This is handy for one-time connection configuration tasks your 
application may need.

This example consists of an RSocket service, `hello-service`, that returns hello messages in the specified language for 
one-to-many recipients. The language is specified at connection setup time using the RSocket `SETUP` frame.

## Building the Example
Run the following command to build the example:

    ./gradlew clean build
    
## Running the Example
Follow the steps below to run the example:

1. Run the following command to start the `hello-service`:

        ./gradlew :hello-service:bootRun
        
2. In a new terminal, run the following command to execute the `hello-client` and ask for hello messages for `Bob`, `Susan`, `Mary`, and `Tom` in United States English:

        ./gradlew :hello-client:bootRun --args="en US Bob Susan Mary Tom"
        
    If successful, you will see the following in the terminal:
    
        : Connecting to hello-service and configuring locale [language: 'en', country: 'US']
        : Requesting '4' hello message(s)...
        : Response: Hello, Bob!
        : Response: Hello, Susan!
        : Response: Hello, Mary!
        : Response: Hello, Tom!
        : Completed!
        
3. Next, run the following command to execute the `hello-client` for French messages:

        ./gradlew :hello-client:bootRun --args="fr FR Bob Susan Mary Tom"
        
    If successful, you will see the following in the terminal:
    
        : Connecting to hello-service and configuring locale [language: 'fr', country: 'FR']
        : Requesting '4' hello message(s)...
        : Response: Bonjour, Bob!
        : Response: Bonjour, Susan!
        : Response: Bonjour, Mary!
        : Response: Bonjour, Tom!
        : Completed!
